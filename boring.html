				<h1>Jesse Fried, Web Developer </h1>
				<p>Jesse Fried is a web developer with a focus on building client-side applications. He enjoys working closely with designers. Specializing in the vue.js framework, he also admires react.js, tolerates backbone.js, and feels there is a place for plain JavaScript. Good friends with CSS, he is grateful every day for SASS. He treasures the deceptively simple skill of writing clean, semantic markup with solid class naming conventions. </p>
				<p>When a web server is called for, he likes to rely on Django. A few data analysis projects have made hime more conversant in Python. Unfortunately he fears and mistrusts AWS other than S3. The bulk of his professional experience has been on the External Web Apps team at ASCAP, where he learned from the best in the business. Other interests include making maps, learning about geology and history, hiking, and playing music.  </p>
